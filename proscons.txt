pros
    Code is clear and simple, should be easy to understand for someone looking at it for the first time. There is no duplicate code. Everything has a single responsibility
and is split into different methods. The methods are relatively short and called inside each other to construct the whole logic. The code formatting is done
according to the set ESlint rules. There is breathing space in the code which makes it easy to read without too much strain.


cons
    Unit testing doesnt handle all the edge cases. Error handling is passable but could be better(i think), the Response types are non existent(I suck , will improve)

    There is a chance that 2 functions will execute at the same time. In the scenario that the clean up function, that executes every x seconds and a request are made 
at the same time, there may pop up an error.
The clean up function for our keys is deteriorating the bigger our store database gets. It will get a lot slower.
We also currently lack the technology to face the problem of a big influx of new keys when we get close to the cap.(Have to decide what is our best and desired counterplay)
