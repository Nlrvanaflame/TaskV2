pros
1 Code is clear and simple, should be easy to understand for someone looking at it for the first time. (like 90% of it, added comments on more complicated parts)
2 There is no unnecessary code (i hope)
3 There is single responsibility
4 Code formatting is decent


cons
Unit testing doesnt handle edge cases
Error handling and Response types are lacking
There is a chance that 2 functions will execute at same time (i suspect its possible that if the function that run every x seconds try to run at the same time we make a request,
there may be a problem )
